This repository just contain this README file, to introduce the content of the different repositories in the ChromatinNetwork organisation. The repositories are organised as follows:

ChromModnets - Infer chromatin state-specific co-location networks from a set of ChIP-Seq or similar experiments.
epistemnet - A web tool to visualize the co-location network.
xxx (co-evolution)
Others - Code used for the rest of the analyses described in the paper.
